    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Subhas_Chandra_Bose_NRB.jpg" alt="Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose">

    <p>
        Subhas Chandra Bose was born on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack, Odisha, into a well-educated Bengali family.
        His father, Janakinath Bose, was a prominent lawyer, and his mother, Prabhavati Devi, deeply influenced
        his moral and spiritual outlook.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bose was academically brilliant. He studied at Presidency College, Calcutta, and later went to England
        to appear for the Indian Civil Services (ICS) examination. In 1920, he secured the fourth position—an
        extraordinary achievement. However, he resigned from the ICS, declaring that he could not serve an
        imperial power that enslaved his nation.
    </p>

    <h2>Entry into the Freedom Struggle</h2>
    <p>
        After returning to India, Bose joined the Indian National Congress and came under the mentorship of
        Chittaranjan Das. Unlike many moderate leaders, Bose believed that independence could not be achieved
        through petitions or constitutional reforms alone.
    </p>

    <p>
        He advocated mass mobilization, disciplined organization, and confrontation with British authority.
        His repeated arrests and imprisonments by the British only strengthened his resolve.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Distance with the Indian National Congress</h2>
    <p>
        Bose’s ideological differences with the Congress leadership—especially Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal
        Nehru—gradually became irreconcilable. While Gandhi emphasized non-violence as both a moral principle
        and political strategy, Bose considered it a tactical limitation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bose was elected President of the Indian National Congress twice (1938 and 1939). However, intense
        opposition from the Gandhian faction forced him to resign. He later formed the Forward Bloc to unite
        radical and left-leaning nationalist forces.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Netaji and Socialism</h2>
    <p>
        Subhas Chandra Bose was deeply influenced by socialist ideas, though his socialism was pragmatic rather
        than doctrinaire. He admired the planned economies of the Soviet Union and believed that India required
        a strong central state to eliminate poverty, inequality, and feudal exploitation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bose envisioned a synthesis of nationalism and socialism—where economic planning, state ownership of
        key industries, and social justice would coexist with national unity and discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
        For Bose, socialism was not class warfare but national reconstruction. He believed that political
        freedom without economic freedom was meaningless.
    </p>

    <h2>Conversation with Hitler and Axis Powers</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Subhas_Chandra_Bose_with_Hitler.jpg" alt="Netaji with Hitler">

    <p>
        During World War II, Bose escaped British surveillance and reached Germany in 1941. He met Adolf Hitler
        to seek support for India’s independence. Bose was clear that his alliance with the Axis powers was
        strategic, not ideological.
    </p>

    <p>
        He rejected Nazi racial theories and criticized Hitler’s views on Asia. Bose emphasized that India’s
        struggle was anti-imperialist, not fascist. When he realized Germany could not provide direct military
        assistance to India, he shifted focus to Japan and Southeast Asia.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>The Indian National Army (INA)</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/INA_flag.svg" alt="INA Flag">

    <p>
        In Southeast Asia, Bose reorganized the Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj). As Supreme Commander, he
        inspired thousands of Indian soldiers and civilians to join the armed struggle against British rule.
    </p>

    <p>
        The INA advanced up to Indian territory during the Imphal and Kohima campaigns. Although militarily
        unsuccessful, the INA shattered the myth of British invincibility and deeply affected the loyalty of
        Indian soldiers in the British Indian Army.
    </p>

    <h2>Views on Imperialism and America</h2>
    <p>
        Bose was a consistent critic of imperialism in all forms—British, European, and American. While he
        acknowledged America’s anti-colonial origins, he warned against emerging American economic and
        political dominance.
    </p>

    <p>
        He foresaw a future where old empires would be replaced by new forms of economic imperialism, and he
        believed newly independent nations must guard their sovereignty fiercely.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Netaji Is Considered One of the Greatest Leaders</h2>
    <p>
        Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose stands apart in world history because he combined intellectual brilliance,
        revolutionary courage, military leadership, and moral conviction.
    </p>

    <p>
        He challenged both colonial power and internal complacency. Unlike many leaders, he was willing to
        sacrifice personal comfort, political popularity, and even life itself for national liberation.
    </p>

    <p>
        His legacy continues to inspire debates on nationalism, socialism, resistance, and sovereignty. Netaji
        represents the idea that freedom is not begged—it is taken.
